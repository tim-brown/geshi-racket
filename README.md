Racket Generator for Geshi Syntax Highlighting for Racket

`racket.php` is included for you. But if you want a fresh one, it's just a matter of:
    racket racket.php.rkt > racket.php

Not really sure how much simpler I can make it.

Here is the current TODO list (as generated by `tasklist.rkt`):

TODO (updated 2013-03-31)
-------------------------
* better handling of empty and short arrays
* care more about indentation and line lengths
* most compound regexps are possibly over-bracketed: `(or ...)`
* most compound regexps are possibly over-bracketed: `(: ...)`
* `'|...|` identifiers
* `#<<HERE` strings
* `#;(...)` comments -- (note: requires balanced parenthesis regexp)
